# Directory Copy and Rename Script

## Overview
This Python script identifies directories containing a specific pattern "game" in their names, copies them from a source directory to a target directory, and renames them by removing the `_game` suffix.

## Features
- Searches for directories with the pattern `"game"`.
- Automatically creates the target directory if it doesnâ€™t exist.
- Copies and renames matching directories for organized storage.

## Usage
1. Run the script using the command:
   python script.py <data> <target_directory>
